- Presentation Layer: Responsible for handling user interactions and displaying data to the user.
- Domain Layer: Defines the business logic and rules of the application.
- Data Layer: Handles data persistence and retrieval.
- Infrastructure Layer: Contains external interfaces such as APIs, databases, and third-party libraries.
